For my project I made a simple store type page where users can browse products related to paganism and witchcraft. 
This was definately a difficult project, but with the help of walkthroughs and lots of googling, I was able to make a functioning site. It was really interesting making the switch from backend to front end, I had gotten so used to having the majority of my code within models and controllers. I struggle with a lot of the html tags, but otherwise really enjoy it.  I'd like to get waay better at styling though, I have a decent understanding of Bootstrap but for this project I used Tailwind, which I found to be considerably harder to navigate. I like the orginazational structure of having the bulk of my functions in a front end .js file, I personally think that it's a lot easier to keep track of what pieces of code I have where. I'm really nervous for my assessment, I'd like to make a few more tweaks if I have the time. The biggest hurdle for me so far in my experience at flatiron is learning to talk through my code. I tend to be able to write it fairly succinctly, and what I'm doing makes sense in my head, but vocalizing the reasoning behind my code and even the output of different functions is something I have a lot of trouble with. I'd like to find a way to become more comfortable using technical terminology and explaining my coding decisions in a clear and consice way. Overall I believe this project was a really good, albeit challenging, experience for me and I look forward to being able to use my skills in more practical applications.
