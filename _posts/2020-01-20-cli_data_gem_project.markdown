For my project, I made a CLI that lists the top five travel destinations of 2020 and gives a little more information about each when prompted. I was excited to start this project, but I really underestimated how much work it was going to be. I made the mistake of starting later than I should have, and then proceeded to put off fixing my errors and ended up building a big chunk of my project on broken code. After this series of slip ups though, I managed to pull it together. I started my project over again completely, and this time I went in order, fixed errors as they happened, and followed Avi's Daily Deals tutorial religiously. 

I built my CLI first, running it with fake data to be sure it worked, before setting about the arduous task of scrapint my data. I had unknowingly chosen a website that was quite complex, but with the help of a lot of googling and a couple of wonserful classmates, I eventually managed to scrape everything I needed. 

Despite my difficulties, I loved this project. The satisfaction that comes every time a new piece of code actually works more than makes up for the frustration when I'm stuck. Programming is hard, and there's SO MUCH information to absorb, but learning how to actually create something is beyond exciting. I'm really looking forward to continuing the program, and learning enough to be able to really contribute in a bigger setting.
