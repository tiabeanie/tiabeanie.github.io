The Rails project has definately been my favorite so far. I really enjoy Rails, I'm just blown away by how much it can do! That being said, it was hard. I managed to get my basic framework built fairly easily, but working out errors from there took much longer. I think my biggest problem really is making sytax errors and then having to find and correct them when they cause problems with the rest of my code. 
I started by building my migrations, which is made really simple with the help of rails generators. I then created my controllers, models, and views. I had to go back and forth from my routes.rb file a few times to get them all worked out, but once it was in order I was good to go! I built my views with a little formatting help from bootstrap, and used my models to make sure that everything was properly connected.
Using OmniAuth was really cool and also way harder than I expected it to be. It actually took me quite a while to get it all in working order so that a user was able to login and signup with their already existing Google account. 
I spent a 5-8 hours a day for the first week building my app, and then a few hours a day following that making small changes and adjustments. I'm really glad I was able to stay on schedule and I'm pretty proud of myself for being able to create a real functioning web app!
