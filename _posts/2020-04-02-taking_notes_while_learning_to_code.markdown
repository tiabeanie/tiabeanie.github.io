I have always absorbed information best when I can write it all down while I learn it. When first coming into coding, trying to figure out an effective way to take notes was really difficult, and I tried a ton of different things. I didn't want to take notes on paper, because I wanted the ability to easily search within them. I liked Evernote, because it gave me the ability to add snippets of code into my notes, but that eventually became ureasonable as I started to learn more complex things. 

Ultimately, the solution that worked best for me was to split my notes into two sections, code and terminology. I take regular notes in Evernote for acronyms, terminology, and definitions. I can then easily turn these into flashcards to study before a project review. This has been really important for me, as I tend to understand the code fairly well when I see it, but I have a hard time keeping track of the names of each new thing, and how exactly they work within my code.

As for taking notes on the actual code, I found that taking notes *in* my code was beyond helpful. With each new method written, I can add a note on what it is and what it's doing. These notes are all commented out of course, so that when I go back and look through my code, I can use the notes to understand why I wrote something the way I did and use the things that worked best in certain situations over again. 
Note taking varies a lot person to person. I know lots of other students only take notes in their code, or don't take notes at all. Some people don't need to write things down, but internalize information when they can explain it to someone else. 

Working out a system that fit into my study style has been hugely beneficial for me, and I would highly reccomend that anyone else learning to code, or learning to do anything, identefies the way that they learn best and incorperate it into their education.
