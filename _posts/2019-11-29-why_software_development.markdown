I first got into coding 8 years ago, when I was 14 and relatively popular on tumblr. I wasn't pleased with the theme options that were offered, so I learned how to make my own. After a few weeks and a lot of tutorials, I had gotten html down well enough to be able to create my own tumblr themes, both for myself and for other people to be able to edit and use. I learned programming on a basic level over the next few years, both for my various internet excursions and so that I could program the robots my high school robotics team built. 

Once I got to college, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do, I changed majors half a dozen times, and I eventually decided that my distaste for the way degree programs are structured overwhelmed my desire to actually get a degree. I still wanted a marketable skill set though, something that offered variety and accessability, that was challenging yet enjoyable. I had never really considered programming as a career, despite my aptitude for STEM subjects, I always gravitated more toward social sciences. After deciding not to finish my college career, I still wanted to be able to learn new things, so I signed up for an online python course on EdX. I immediately loved it, and made the decision to start looking into coding bootcamps, and a few months later I was accepted to Flatiron and enrolled in the software engineering track. 

We're three weeks into the course, and I know I made the right decision. The work is hard, and it certainly requires a lot of dedication to learn, but the array of possibilities makes it worth it. I love the constant challenge, I love the fact that I will always have more to learn, and I'm beyond happy to have found something that really fits. Over the next few months, I plan to document my Flatiron journey, both from a technical perspective, and from a personal one.
